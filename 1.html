  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</p>
  <img src = "coding.png" width = "400">
  <p style = "margin-top:40px;">With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
  It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
  HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
